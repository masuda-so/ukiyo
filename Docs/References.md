# Implementation References

This bibliography records API, design, toolchain, and product references for
Ukiyo. A reference listed here does not by itself mean source code was copied
or adapted. Where distributed sample code informed the implementation,
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) records the source,
applicable license, and local scope.

Tutorials are included only when they document platform behavior or an
implementation pattern used by the app; their inclusion does not make them
normative.

## Product feature references

- [Bringing Photos picker to your SwiftUI app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/bringing-photos-picker-to-your-swiftui-app):
  the app now retains the distributed `ProfileModel`, `ImageState`,
  `TransferError`, `ProfileImage`, `@Published` state, main-queue result delivery,
  stale-selection guard, and state-rendering `ProfileImage` view. Ukiyo also
  retains and cancels the returned `Progress` when a selection is superseded
  or cleared. Only the
  unrelated profile text fields are omitted; `Combine` is explicitly imported
  for the target's `MemberImportVisibility` compiler setting.
- [PhotosPickerItem loadTransferable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photosui/photospickeritem/loadtransferable%28type%3A%29)
  and [CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagesourcecreatethumbnailatindex%28_%3A_%3A_%3A%29):
  display loading remains in the Apple-derived model. Saving uses a separate local
  `LensImageTransfer`, rechecks the current selection, then downsamples and
  encodes away from the main actor before persistence. `LensView` retains the save
  task and cancels it when the selection changes or the view disappears;
  `ImagePreparation` propagates that cancellation to its detached operation.

## Family-wide references

- [Food Truck](https://github.com/apple/sample-food-truck/tree/3954a769e99f3cc53297d94f2b960ceb2665b3d6):
  `General`, `Navigation`, feature folders, and StoreKit transaction listeners.
- [Backyard Birds](https://github.com/apple/sample-backyard-birds/tree/1843d5655bf884b501e2889ad9862ec58978fdbe):
  app-specific feature folders, StoreKit configuration, and adaptive navigation.
- [ml-comlet](https://github.com/apple/ml-comlet/tree/c3811e7367c1a211698078c8ffbc11e282e3c794):
  `Services`, model separation, localization, and `Supporting Files`.
- [Foundation Models sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/adding-intelligent-app-features-with-generative-models):
  the downloadable availability switch is an adopted unit. Coffee Game and
  Origami, listed below, supply the adopted response, cancellation, prompt, and
  error-handling units; the app protocol boundary, validation policy, stable
  vocabulary, and product instructions remain local.
- [Generate dynamic game content with guided generation and tools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generate-dynamic-game-content-with-guided-generation-and-tools)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/86c65aeb21cc/GenerateDynamicGameContentWithGuidedGenerationAndTools.zip)):
  adopted model availability and the separate instructions/prompt,
  nonstreaming `respond(to:)`, and response-content units from Apple's Coffee
  Game.
- [Origami: Crafting a dynamic tutorial for Apple Intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/origami-crafting-a-dynamic-tutorial-for-apple-intelligence)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e843a4026a2e/OrigamiCraftingADynamicTutorialForAppleIntelligence.zip)):
  adopted the post-response cancellation check and iOS 27 Foundation Models
  error-type branching. Dynamic profiles, image prompts, streaming, term
  extraction, and the sample's cache are outside the local adoption units.
- [Generative AI Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/generative-ai)
  and [Foundation Models acceptable-use requirements](https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/acceptable-use-requirements-for-the-foundation-models-framework):
  people remain in control through explicit AI labeling, cancellation, review guidance,
  a usable non-AI path, and use-case-specific safety boundaries.
- [Instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/instructions):
  developer-owned behavior remains in trusted instructions; user-provided content is
  delimited in the lower-priority prompt and is never interpolated into instructions.

## Platform verification

- [App icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/)
  and [Creating your app icon using Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-your-app-icon-using-icon-composer):
  `Resources/AppIcon.icon` is the sole primary app-icon source. Xcode renders the
  required platform, appearance, and legacy-size variants from its layered artwork.
- [Localizing and varying text with a string catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog)
  and [Managing your app’s information property list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/managing-your-app-s-information-property-list):
  interface text uses `Localizable.xcstrings`; the localizable `CFBundleDisplayName`
  and `CFBundleName` values use the target-specific InfoPlist String Catalog.
- [Accessibility fundamentals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibility-fundamentals):
  selected and saved images receive explicit accessible descriptions.
- [Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode/):
  local StoreKit configurations and scheme selection.
- [StoreKit Test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekittest):
  `SKTestSession` loads the source configuration by URL for product, verified
  purchase and finishing, restore, and Daily Pass boundary tests. Tests run
  serially because all test sessions control one environment; the configuration
  remains outside the app bundle.
- [Understanding StoreKit workflows](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/understanding-storekit-workflows)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6b864cb1ff7d/UnderstandingStoreKitWorkflows.zip)):
  adopted the grouped `ProductID` structure and the unfinished, current
  entitlement, update, verified-processing, and `finish()` kernels.
- [Implementing a store in your app using the StoreKit API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/implementing-a-store-in-your-app-using-the-storekit-api)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/623bce0ddaba/ImplementingAStoreInYourAppUsingTheStoreKitAPI.zip)):
  the 2026 sample is a latest-behavior cross-check only; no additional code
  adoption claim is made from this Apple-sample-license distribution.
- [iOS & iPadOS 26.6 RC Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_6-release-notes):
  Apple records the earlier iOS 26.5 Simulator `SKTestSession` connection defect
  as fixed under StoreKit (FB22500243). This historical troubleshooting note
  neither selects the release toolchain nor proves the StoreKit integration.
  End-to-end verification remains pending on an Apple-distributed compatible
  runtime, compatible physical device, or TestFlight.
- [Apple Developer Forums: iOS 26.5 CLI StoreKit report](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/808030):
  historical, non-normative field evidence for the earlier `Code=3` failure and
  IDE-only workaround; it doesn't explain or replace evidence for the iOS 27 run.
- [Select an App Store version release option](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/select-an-app-store-version-release-option/)
  and [Submit an In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-an-in-app-purchase/):
  release timing is configured separately from App Review, and each first product
  type is submitted with the initial app version. No current submission date is
  assumed in this repository.
- [Transaction.currentEntitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlements):
  the all-product sequence supplies verified current transactions, including the latest
  non-renewing purchase, and the client filters them against the app catalog.
- [Task cancellation and sleep](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/):
  the Daily Pass monitor retains and cancels its task, uses a cancellable sleep, and
  receives the same injectable wall clock as entitlement calculation.
- [Handling subscriptions billing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/handling-subscriptions-billing):
  app-owned duration, restoration, and cross-device responsibilities for a
  non-renewing subscription.
- [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/):
  role-based type names, labeled weakly typed parameters, clarity at the call site,
  fluent method names, and concise Markdown comments for reusable APIs.
- [Writing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/writing):
  assistant and commerce diagnostics remain internal, while localized interface errors
  use plain language and give a clear retry action.
- [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format):
  the Swift toolchain formatter and strict linter enforce the repository's pinned
  two-space indentation, import ordering, line length, documentation, and
  force-unwrap safety rules. Swift does not prescribe this as the only valid style;
  adopting one identical configuration across the five apps is a local consistency
  decision.

## Adopted implementation and local decisions

- [Xcode support](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
  and [App Store Connect release notes](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/release-notes/):
  the App Store submission toolchain remains a release gate. Before submission,
  repeat the build, test, Analyze, and Archive checks with the current stable
  Xcode and a supported SDK; beta-toolchain results are not release evidence.
- [Foundation Models updates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/foundationmodels):
  Swift 6.4 builds map the iOS 27 `LanguageModelError`,
  `SystemLanguageModel.Error`, and `LanguageModelSession.Error` types. A compiler
  condition keeps those SDK-27 declarations out of Swift 6.3 builds; iOS 26 uses
  the common safe fallback without reintroducing the deprecated generation type.
  Origami's downloadable error translation is the adopted comparison unit for
  the shared `SystemLanguageModel.Error` and `LanguageModelError` branches.
- [Supporting languages and locales](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/supporting-languages-and-locales-with-foundation-models):
  locale support is checked before sending a prompt.
- [Preserving SwiftData models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/preserving-your-apps-model-data-across-launches):
  `ModelContainer`, `ModelContext`, and `@Query` provide local persistence.
- [`Schema.Attribute.Option.externalStorage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/schema/attribute/option/externalstorage):
  Ukiyo uses the documented adjacent binary-data storage option for `LensImage.imageData`;
  choosing it for this product model remains a local decision, not tutorial code.
- [ModelContext transaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/transaction%28block%3A%29)
  and [rollback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/rollback%28%29):
  user-initiated mutations run inside `performTransactionOrRollback(_:)`, so failures in either
  the changes or their save discard the complete pending unit before the app presents an
  error. The wrapper name and shared alert policy are family-wide implementation decisions.
- [Privacy manifest files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy-manifest-files):
  the current manifest declares no tracking or collected data. Recheck the final
  source, dependencies, and Archive against Apple's current required-reason API
  list before confirming App Store privacy answers.

The current `ukiyo/Resources/AppIcon.icon` is the sole layered Icon Composer
source and uses locally created foreground artwork rather than an SF Symbol.
Apple's icon documentation governs packaging and appearance rendering. Confirm
the rendered icon in the final Archive and on supported devices. The final
determination is the submitted build's App Review;
[App Review guideline 2.3.9](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#accurate-metadata)
requires accurate metadata and sufficient rights.

Apple doesn't prescribe one universal app-folder layout. Ukiyo therefore follows
the recurring official-sample pattern of app, model, service, resource, and
feature-specific groups. The Daily Pass is an app-owned policy: it uses StoreKit's
verified purchase date plus 24 hours and the device wall clock, without a server.

The downloaded samples include their own Apple or MIT license notices. Ukiyo adapts
the relevant patterns instead of redistributing any sample project unchanged.
